## Imperative programming
In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm 
of software that uses statements that change a program's state.
Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates 
step by step, rather than on high-level descriptions of its expected 
results.

## Functional programming
In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm 
where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. 
It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions 
are trees of expressions that map values to other values, rather than 
a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of 
the program.
